## Context
Enterprise S/4HANA transformation required centralized access governance aligned to SOX and regulated controls.

## My Role
SAP Security & GRC Solution Architect / SME (design authority for access governance and SoD framework)

## What I Designed
- SAP GRC 12.0 landscape and integration approach for S/4HANA and ECC
- Enterprise role hierarchy and access governance model (300+ roles)
- Segregation of Duties (SoD) rules and risk-based approval workflows
- Request/approval flow design to standardize provisioning and reduce manual exceptions

## Tools & Platforms
SAP GRC 12.0, S/4HANA, ECC, SAP Fiori, SolMan/CHARM (where applicable)

## Impact
- **45% reduction** in compliance risk
- **100% audit compliance** for SOX / ITGC control reviews
- Governance model designed to scale across multiple business entities
