## Context
High-risk SoD conflicts were identified in a live S/4 production environment, with no room for business disruption.

## My Role
SAP GRC / Security lead owning risk analysis, remediation plan, and business coordination

## Approach
- Used GRC risk analysis to isolate the exact conflict combinations and impacted roles/users
- Coordinated with business owners to understand operational timelines and critical activities
- Applied controlled emergency access (Firefighter) only where required, with full logging and approvals
- Redesigned roles to permanently separate duties and reduce recurrence
- Implemented compensating controls where immediate redesign wasn’t feasible

## Impact
- Business operations continued without interruption
- High-risk SoD conflicts were reduced and governed with traceable controls
- Audit trail and evidence were clean and easy to validate
